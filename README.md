# IP-Analyser

The goal of this project is to create a simple web application that allows users to enter an IP address, fetch information about that IP address using an external API (specifically, the ipinfo.io API), and display the retrieved information on the web page.

Key Features:

    User-friendly interface with clear input and output sections.
    Input validation to ensure a valid IP address is entered.
    Fetching and displaying detailed information about the provided IP address, including ISP, ASN, city, region, country, and location.
    Error handling for cases where the API request fails or invalid input is provided.

Technologies Used:

    HTML: For structuring the web page.
    CSS: For styling the web page and making it visually appealing.
    JavaScript: For implementing the application's functionality and handling user interactions.
    External API (ipinfo.io): To retrieve IP address information.
    HTTP Requests: Used to communicate with the ipinfo.io API.
